# Project2
This project automates CI/CD using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. It pulls code from GitHub, builds a Docker image, pushes it to Docker Hub, and deploys it to an AWS EKS cluster. The pipeline ensures seamless deployment and efficient application delivery with automated build and deployment processes.
